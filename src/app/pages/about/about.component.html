                I am a <strong>Software Developer</strong> with several years of professional experience, skilled in
                writing clean code
                with strong knowledge of <strong>Front-end
                    development</strong>, mainly <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong> 
                    framework alongside HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4 for responsive Front-end development. 
                    Beside Front-end technologies, I have experience in Back-end using Java on the Spring Framework. 
                    Experienced with modern tooling such as Git and Jira, and excited to pick up the right tools for the job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning is a passion of mine, so I am constantly learning how I can improve on already existing skills and learn new libraries or frameworks to expand my skill set. 
                I also like to share my knowledge through mentoring programs and live lectures to help people improve their knowledge so our Dev Community can grow. 
                I am highly motivated by new technologies such as the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> and
                <strong>E-commerce</strong> web apps.
            </p>
